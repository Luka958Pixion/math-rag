      "Last time we introduced the logistic regression algorithm. We defined the model and derived the cross-entropy error function as the negative probability of the labels in the training set. We established that minimizing that error had no solution in closed form, so we turned to iterative procedures. We have considered the simplest such procedure, the gradient descent algorithm, and we applied it to logistic regression, in standard (batch) and stochastic variant. In the end, we talked about regularization, specifically [math_placeholder | 0] regularization, which we incorporated quite straightforwardly into the optimization process.\n",

      "Today we'll talk a bit more about logistic regression. First, we'll consider some more efficient (read: faster) alternatives to gradient descent. Second, we'll consider the extension of binary logistic regression to multiclass logistic regression. Third, we'll look at all the models discussed thus far and see what they have in common and how they can be generalized. Finally, we'll talk about adaptive basis functions, which is a way to learn the feature mapping function directly from data, instead of defining it manually.\n",

This means that, depending on where the descent initially starts, it can happen that the gradient descent does not converge but diverge (effectively it starts to ascend instead of descend). Line search prevents this from happening. However, line search can result in a zig-zag descent. Let's recall the figure we discussed last time:\n",

Which one will play out depends on the choice of the starting point of the search. As we can see, it can happen that the descent zig-zags quite a lot, which means that the optimization will consume a lot of iterations. Obviously, the problem arises because the descent direction is not as good as it could be. Imagine descending into a pit from the starting point for the red trajectory. It is hard to imagine that you will descend\n",
      "as pointed to by the line. It is more likely that the gravity would pull you and your descend direction would be steeper (i.e., at a smaller angle to the blue line). This reasoning of ours is based on the curvature of the isocontours (that is, the curvature of the surface down which we descend). In other words, the curvature of the surface gives us, in addition to the gradient, additional information about where the minimum is likely to be located (at least when it comes to convex functions).\n",

      "The above observations apply to the standard (batch) gradient. In stochastic gradient descent we typically do not use line search. But there the descent will zig-zag quite a lot anyway, since each step is taken based on the gradient calculated for a single example. In the following, we focus on non-stochastic, i.e., batch gradient descent.\n",

Such optimization methods are referred to as second-order optimization, as opposed to first-order optimization methods, such as gradient descent. The basic second-order optimization method is the Newton's method.\n",

The Hessian matrix is a square [math_placeholder | 29] matrix of second-order partial derivatives of function [math_placeholder | 30], which is a function that maps [math_placeholder | 31]-dimensional vectors into scalars.

However, for its inverse to exist, the matrix [math_placeholder | 41] has to be positive definite ( [math_placeholder | 42] for each non-zero vector [math_placeholder | 43] ). If [math_placeholder | 44] is positive semi-definite, but not positive definite, then [math_placeholder | 45] has no inverse and we cannot apply the Newton's method.\n",

Just in case, let's check the compatibility of the matrices we multiply here: [math_placeholder | 51] [math_placeholder | 52]. Everything is fine: the dimension of the matrix [math_placeholder | 53] is [math_placeholder | 54], where [math_placeholder | 55] is the number of features in the feature space (i.e., after mapping).\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's go back quickly to the problem of computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix [math_placeholder | 56]. As we already said, [math_placeholder | 57] is positive semi-definite if and only if the function is convex. The crossentropy error is convex, so the [math_placeholder | 58] matrix for logistic regression will be positive semi-definite. But this alone does not guarantee it is invertible. However, one can show that the Hessian matrix [math_placeholder | 59] of cross-entropy, which can be decomposed as [math_placeholder | 60], must be positive definite. In other words, the Hessian matrix of the cross entropy error always has an inverse, so we can always use the Newton's method to optimize the parameters of logistic regression. However, due to multicollinearity, [math_placeholder | 61] may be ill-conditioned and in this case the solution will be unstable, which means we have to either select a linearly independent subset of features or apply regularization (we'll see how soon).\n",
      "\n",
      "If we were now to plug in [math_placeholder | 62] for [math_placeholder | 63] in the weights update rule above, and rearrange the expression a bit, we would obtain the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm (hrv. algoritam najmanjih kvadrata s iterativnim ažuriranjem težina). We won't go into the details; it suffices for you to know that this algorithm is used for faster optimization for logistic regression, and that it is in fact an application of the Newton's method, which is a second-order optimization procedure.\n",

      "The problem with Newton's method (and thus with IRLS) is that the computation of the Hessian (and especially its inverse) can be expensive (especially if [math_placeholder | 64], the number of dimensions of the feature space, is large). Note that one has to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse in every step of the optimization procedure. It might well be the case that doing gradient descent is less taxing computationally, even if the descent zig-zags a lot!\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative is that, instead of computing the exact Hessian matrix, we compute its approximation. This is what the so-called quasi-Newton methods do. These procedures using the gradient vectors (from the current and previous step) to approximate the Hessian matrix (or its inverse) in each step of the descent. The most common such method is the BFSG algorithm. Again, we won't go into details, we just want you to be aware that the method exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem is that, even if we approximate the Hessian matrix, storing it in memory can be problematic because its dimensions are [math_placeholder | 65]. In that case, the matrix can be \"compressed\" using a low-rank approximation method. The algorithm that works that way is the limited BFSG (L-BFSG) (hrv. ograničen BFSG). Again, it suffices for you to know that this algorithm exists.\n",

      "We already know about the benefits of regularization, and last time we talked about the additional benefit of regularization in logistic regression (when optimizing the parameters for linearly separable problems, we have [math_placeholder | 66] and logistic regression overfits easily). Extending the Newton's method to regularized cross-entropy error is simple. Let's look at [math_placeholder | 67] regulation.

Namely, instead of searching analytically for the minimum of the error function, we can calculate the gradient of the error function, and then apply the gradient descent.

But let's look first at how one could go about parameterizing the basis functions. One possibility is to say that each basis function is a small generalized linear model on its own!

We use the LMS rule for online learning.\\n\\nFinally, let's look at the multinomial logistic regression:\\n\\n[\\\\begin{aligned}\\nh_{k}(\\\\mathbf{x} ; \\\\mathbf{W}) & =\\\\operatorname{softmax}\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{w}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{w}_{k}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right)}{\\\\sum_{j} \\\\exp \\\\left(\\\\mathbf{w}_{j}^{\\\\mathrm{T}} \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right)}=P(y=k \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{w}) \\\\\\\\\\nP(\\\\mathbf{y} \\\\mid \\\\mathbf{x}, \\\\mathbf{w}) & =\\\\prod_{k=1}^{K} \\\\mu_{k}^{y_{k}}=\\\\prod_{k=1}^{K} h_{k}(\\\\mathbf{x})^{y_{k}} \\\\\\\\\\nL\\\\left(\\\\mathbf{y}, h_{k}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right) & =-\\\\sum_{k=1}^{K} y_{k} \\\\ln h_{k}(\\\\mathbf{x} ; \\\\mathbf{W}) \\\\\\\\\\n\\\\nabla_{\\\\mathbf{w}_{k}} L\\\\left(y_{k}, h_{k}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\\\right) & =\\\\left(h_{k}(\\\\mathbf{x})-y_{k}\\\\right) \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\phi}(\\\\mathbf{x})\\n\\\\end{aligned} | 157]\\n\\nWe use the same (mutatis mutandis) optimization procedures for model learning as for logistic regression.\\n\\nNotice the commonalities. For all three algorithms, we derived the loss function from the negative logarithm of the probability of labels of the examples from the dataset. We did this by using the normal, Bernoulli, and multinoulli distribution distribution for linear, binary logistic, and multinoulli logistic regression, respectively. Furthermore, for all three algorithms we derived an identical rule (the LMS) for online weights update.\\n\\nThe question is: how come we always get the same weights update rule? Also, what is the relationship between the logistic function and the Bernoulli variable, and between the softmax function and the multinoulli distribution? There seems to be a connection, because in both cases we obtained the cross-entropy error. The answer lies in the properties of the distributions we used to model the labels [y^{(i)} | 158].\\n\\n\\nThe distributions we have encountered so far (Gaussian, Bernoulli, multinoulli), but also some others that are often used in\")]"
