We established that minimizing that error had no solution in closed form, so we turned to iterative procedures. We have considered the simplest such procedure, the gradient descent algorithm, and we applied it to logistic regression, in standard (batch) and stochastic variant. In the end, we talked about regularization, specifically [math_placeholder | 0] regularization, which we incorporated quite straightforwardly into the optimization process.\n",

      "Today we'll talk a bit more about logistic regression. First, we'll consider some more efficient (read: faster) alternatives to gradient descent. Second, we'll consider the extension of binary logistic regression to multiclass logistic regression. Third, we'll look at all the models discussed thus far and see what they have in common and how they can be generalized. Finally, we'll talk about adaptive basis functions, which is a way to learn the feature mapping function directly from data, instead of defining it manually.\n",

This means that, depending on where the descent initially starts, it can happen that the gradient descent does not converge but diverge (effectively it starts to ascend instead of descend). Line search prevents this from happening. However, line search can result in a zig-zag descent. Let's recall the figure we discussed last time:\n",

Which one will play out depends on the choice of the starting point of the search. As we can see, it can happen that the descent zig-zags quite a lot, which means that the optimization will consume a lot of iterations. Obviously, the problem arises because the descent direction is not as good as it could be. Imagine descending into a pit from the starting point for the red trajectory. It is hard to imagine that you will descend\n",
      "as pointed to by the line. It is more likely that the gravity would pull you and your descend direction would be steeper (i.e., at a smaller angle to the blue line). This reasoning of ours is based on the curvature of the isocontours (that is, the curvature of the surface down which we descend). In other words, the curvature of the surface gives us, in addition to the gradient, additional information about where the minimum is likely to be located (at least when it comes to convex functions).\n",

But there the descent will zig-zag quite a lot anyway, since each step is taken based on the gradient calculated for a single example. In the following, we focus on non-stochastic, i.e., batch gradient descent.\n",

The basic second-order optimization method is the Newton's method.\n",

As we already said, [math_placeholder | 57] is positive semi-definite if and only if the function is convex. The crossentropy error is convex, so the [math_placeholder | 58] matrix for logistic regression will be positive semi-definite. But this alone does not guarantee it is invertible. However, one can show that the Hessian matrix [math_placeholder | 59] of cross-entropy, which can be decomposed as [math_placeholder | 60], must be positive definite. In other words, the Hessian matrix of the cross entropy error always has an inverse, so we can always use the Newton's method to optimize the parameters of logistic regression. However, due to multicollinearity, [math_placeholder | 61] may be ill-conditioned and in this case the solution will be unstable, which means we have to either select a linearly independent subset of features or apply regularization (we'll see how soon).\n",

      "The problem with Newton's method (and thus with IRLS) is that the computation of the Hessian (and especially its inverse) can be expensive (especially if [math_placeholder | 64], the number of dimensions of the feature space, is large). Note that one has to compute the Hessian matrix and its inverse in every step of the optimization procedure. It might well be the case that doing gradient descent is less taxing computationally, even if the descent zig-zags a lot!\n",
      "\n",
      "The alternative is that, instead of computing the exact Hessian matrix, we compute its approximation. This is what the so-called quasi-Newton methods do. These procedures using the gradient vectors (from the current and previous step) to approximate the Hessian matrix (or its inverse) in each step of the descent. The most common such method is the BFSG algorithm. Again, we won't go into details, we just want you to be aware that the method exists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another problem is that, even if we approximate the Hessian matrix, storing it in memory can be problematic because its dimensions are [math_placeholder | 65]. In that case, the matrix can be \"compressed\" using a low-rank approximation method. The algorithm that works that way is the limited BFSG (L-BFSG) (hrv. ograničen BFSG). Again, it suffices for you to know that this algorithm exists.\n",

We instead compute the subgradient (engl. podgradijent). We then typically use the coordinate descent (engl. koordinatni spust), where we optimize by each variable in term (dimension after dimension), or we use proximal or projection optimization methods.

When we introduced linear regression, we were actually talking only about batch optimization, which is achieved by calculating the pseudoinverse of the design matrix. However, already then we could have resorted to a stochastic (i.e., online) weight update. Namely, instead of searching analytically for the minimum of the error function, we can calculate the gradient of the error function, and then apply the gradient descent. (We didn't do that at that at that time, probably because we were blinded by the sheer elegance of the closed-form solution). Well, let's do it now.

Furthermore, for all three algorithms we derived an identical rule (the LMS) for online weights update.\n",

Also, what is the relationship between the logistic function and the Bernoulli variable, and between the softmax function and the multinoulli distribution?

The answer lies in the properties of the distributions we used to model the labels [math_placeholder | 158].\n",

      "The distributions we have encountered so far (Gaussian, Bernoulli, multinoulli), but also some others that are often used in machine learning (binomial, multinomial, Student's t-distribution, uniform, beta distribution, gamma distribution, Dirichlet's) belong to the so-called exponential family (hrv. eksponencijalna familija).

      "What is of interesting to us here is that it is that the exponential family is crucial for for generalized linear models. Specifically, for the distributions belonging to the exponential family (including Gaussian, Bernoulli, and multinoulli) there is a relationship between the distribution and its (possibly nonlinear) activation function [math_placeholder | 160]. This function is in this context is referred to as the mean function (hrv. funkcija sredine), because it defines the [math_placeholder | 161] parameter of a distribution, i.e., the distribution's mean. Thus, the activation function [math_placeholder | 162] therefore [math_placeholder | 163] as a function of [math_placeholder | 164]. You probably already guessed that for the Gaussian distribution the activation function is an identity function, since [math_placeholder | 165].

In other words, we generally don't know which feature mapping will make our problem linearly separable in feature space.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can solve this problem by letting the basis functions adapt to our data (examples from the training set). Here we have two options: the first, used by the aforementioned kernel machines, is to select some examples from the training set as prototypes, and then make the basis functions measure the similarity between an input example and these prototypes. This adjusts the total number of basis functions depending on the data. Another possibility is to use a fixed number of basis functions, but let each of them adapt to the data. Let's look into that in a bit more detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea of adaptive basis functions is to define them up to some parameters, which we can then adjust to the data. That is, we will define parameterized basis functions. Does that sound familiar? Of course. It is exactly the same as training machine learning models: we define a function up to some parameters, and the parameters are determined by optimizing the empirical error on the training set. But let's look first at how one could go about parameterizing the basis functions. One possibility is to say that each basis function is a small generalized linear model on its own! So, we will have a generalized linear model and within it we'll have generalized linear models as its basis functions:\n",
